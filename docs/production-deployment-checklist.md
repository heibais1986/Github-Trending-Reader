# Production Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures a smooth and secure production deployment of the GitHub Trending API.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Cloudflare account is set up and verified
- [ ] Wrangler CLI is installed and authenticated
- [ ] GitHub Personal Access Token is created with `public_repo` scope
- [ ] All required secrets are configured in Cloudflare Workers

### 2. Code Quality
- [ ] All tests are passing (`npm test`)
- [ ] Code linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Security audit passes (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Performance tests are satisfactory
- [ ] Code review is completed

### 3. Configuration Verification
- [ ] `wrangler.toml` is properly configured for production
- [ ] KV namespace IDs are set correctly
- [ ] Environment variables are configured
- [ ] Cron triggers are set up for daily data scraping
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured appropriately

### 4. Security Review
- [ ] Secrets are stored securely (not in code)
- [ ] CORS configuration is restrictive for production
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled

## Deployment Process

### 1. Final Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run security audit
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Test locally
wrangler dev --env production
```

### 2. Deploy to Staging First
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy.sh --env staging

# Verify staging deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh --env staging
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh --env production

# Verify production deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh --env production
```

### 4. Custom Domain Setup (Optional)
```bash
# Set up custom domain
./scripts/setup-custom-domain.sh --domain api.yourdomain.com --env production

# Verify custom domain
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh --domain api.yourdomain.com --env production
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Functional Testing
- [ ] Health endpoint responds correctly (`/health`)
- [ ] API trending endpoint works (`/api/trending`)
- [ ] Historical data endpoint works (`/api/trending?date=YYYY-MM-DD`)
- [ ] CORS headers are present
- [ ] Rate limiting is working
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

### 2. Performance Testing
- [ ] Response times are acceptable (< 500ms)
- [ ] API can handle expected load
- [ ] Memory usage is within limits
- [ ] Cold start times are reasonable

### 3. Security Testing
- [ ] Security headers are present
- [ ] SSL/TLS is working correctly
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Cloudflare Analytics is enabled
- [ ] Error reporting is configured
- [ ] Log monitoring is set up
- [ ] Alerts are configured for critical issues

## Scheduled Tasks Verification

### 1. Cron Job Testing
- [ ] Scheduled task is configured correctly
- [ ] Manual trigger works (`wrangler cron trigger`)
- [ ] Data scraping completes successfully
- [ ] Data is stored in KV correctly
- [ ] Error handling works for failed scrapes

### 2. Data Validation
- [ ] Scraped data format is correct
- [ ] Data is being updated daily
- [ ] Historical data is preserved (7 days)
- [ ] Old data is cleaned up properly

## HarmonyOS App Integration

### 1. API Configuration
- [ ] App is configured to use production API URL
- [ ] Custom domain is configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Network permissions are set correctly
- [ ] SSL certificate validation is enabled

### 2. App Testing
- [ ] App can fetch trending repositories
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Loading states are displayed properly
- [ ] User interactions work as expected

## Rollback Plan

### 1. Immediate Rollback
If critical issues are discovered:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback --env production

# Or deploy previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit>
./scripts/deploy.sh --env production
```

### 2. Gradual Rollback
For less critical issues:
- [ ] Disable scheduled tasks temporarily
- [ ] Fix issues in staging
- [ ] Deploy fix to production
- [ ] Re-enable scheduled tasks

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Daily Monitoring
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Verify data scraping is working
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check resource usage

### 2. Weekly Maintenance
- [ ] Review logs for issues
- [ ] Check security alerts
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed
- [ ] Verify backup data integrity

### 3. Monthly Review
- [ ] Analyze performance metrics
- [ ] Review security configuration
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Plan improvements
